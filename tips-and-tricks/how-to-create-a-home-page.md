# How to Create a Home Page for Supernote Devices

Having a home page can speed up your workflow so you don't have to dig through your folders to open a notebook.

1. Create a new note. Name it whatever you like. I named mine ```Home.note```.

2. Draw icons, text, or whatever you want to use as a home page. I drew a few icons with some text at the bottom. I added the link to the text but you can add it to the drawing also.

3. Use the lasso tool to make a selection.

4. Add a link to another note file, pdf, or a specific note page. If you link to a note file, every time you click on the link, it will take you to the last page you had open on that file. If you link directly to a page, it will always take to that specific page, even if you add more pages to your notebook.

5. Add your home page note to the quick access menu. Select the three dots in the toolbar and choose either ```Current Page``` or ```Current Note```.

6. Bonus step is to hide the link using a new layer. I actually prefer to see the link icon, but some people might prefer the cleaner look.
